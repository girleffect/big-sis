## Page types
Your website consists of a variety of page types. Each page type has different properties.<br>
All page types have two edit tabs: the **Content tab** and the **Promote tab**.<br><br>
The main content of each page is located under the Content tab which is organized into sections.<br>
The most common sections under **Content tab** are the **Header Section** and the **Body Section**.<br><br>
Under the **Promote tab** you can edit the page’s **SEO details** such as the preview title, the meta description and the image of the page for when it appears in search engine results or when it’s posted on social media. Below you can read a description for each page type.
